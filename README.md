This page shows you how deep the ocean really is, all the way down to its deepest point. For a school assignment, we were supposed to create a timeline of events, but I wanted to do something differentâ€”so I built this project instead.

Back then, I was really proud of what I made, and I still am. But what stands out most is how much fun I had creating it.
